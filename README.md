# m5_forecast_accuracy
 Repository for submission to the M5 Forecast Competition hosted on Kaggle. The objective of the competition is to spur development on time series forecasting. The data for the competition comprise of 30,490 timeseries of sales of products across ten Walmart stores in 3 U.S. states. The notebook attached is a public workbook and is therefore incomplete for purposes of keeping my competition code hidden. However, it does include benchmark modelling.
